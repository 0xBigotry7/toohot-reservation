-- Fix admin_settings table RLS policies for service role access

-- Drop the existing policy that's causing issues
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON admin_settings;

-- Create a more permissive policy that allows service role access
-- Service role bypasses RLS, but let's also allow direct access for this admin table
CREATE POLICY "Allow service role and admin access" ON admin_settings
  FOR ALL 
  USING (true);  -- Allow all access for now since this is an admin-only table

-- Alternative: You could disable RLS entirely for this table since it's admin-only
-- ALTER TABLE admin_settings DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Ensure the table exists and has proper default data
